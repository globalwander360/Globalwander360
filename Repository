Subject: Clarification on Unused API for Transaction Properties

Hi

I had previously developed an API to access Transaction Properties. However, based on suggestions from Bhavin and Amit, I’ve implemented a caching mechanism using referential data, which is now working properly.

Currently, the API is not being used. I wanted to check with you — should I keep this API in the codebase for potential future use, or would you prefer that I remove it for now?

Please let me know how you'd like me to proceed.

Best regards,
Harish
